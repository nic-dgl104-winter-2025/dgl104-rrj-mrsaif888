# Week 8
## Activity 1: Language Research
### LUA Programming Language
Lua is a lightweight, high-performance scripting language designed for embedded systems and game development. It is known for its simple syntax, efficiency, and flexibility.
### Key Features of Lua:
* Lightweight & Fast: Small memory footprint, making it ideal for embedded systems.
* Easy to Embed: Used in game engines (like Unity, Roblox, and LOVE2D) and applications.
* Garbage Collection: Manages memory efficiently.
* Dynamic Typing: No need to declare variable types.
* Simple Syntax: Easy to learn and read.

### Basic Syntax 
```
-- Print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")

-- Variables
name = "Saif"
age = 25

-- Conditional Statement
if age > 18 then
    print(name .. " is an adult.")
else
    print(name .. " is a minor.")
end

-- Loops
for i = 1, 5 do
    print("Number: " .. i)
end

-- Functions
function greet(person)
    return "Hello, " .. person .. "!"
end
print(greet("Saif"))
```

### Why Learn Lua?

* Beginner-friendly syntax.
* High-performance scripting.
* Used in game modding and automation.

### What are some useful resources?
1. Lua Official Website – The primary source for Lua documentation, tutorials, and updates.
2. Programming in Lua (PIL) – A must-read book by Lua's creator, Roberto Ierusalimschy.
3. Lua Reference Manual – Covers all core functionalities.

## Activity 2: User Story 
#### User Story for Spotify’s "Download for Offline Use" feature
As a user, I want to download songs for offline listening, so I can enjoy music without an internet connection.

### 1. Downloading Songs & Playlists

### 3. Offline Playback Experience

* "As a user, I can switch to ‘Offline Mode’ to only see downloaded songs."
* "As a user, I can play my downloaded songs even when I have no internet."
* "As a user, I should get a warning if I try to play an un-downloaded song in offline mode."

### 4. Syncing & Expiry
