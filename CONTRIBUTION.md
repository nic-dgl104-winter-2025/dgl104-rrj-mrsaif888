#  My Contribution â€“ Saif

This file outlines the specific tasks I worked on for the **Smart Task Management System (STMS)** project. I collaborated with two other team members, and my primary responsibility was focused on the **Admin Module**, as well as enhancing the overall **UI and design consistency** of the project.

##  What I Worked On

###  Admin Login Functionality

- I developed a secure **login process for Admins** using PHP and sessions.
- Connected the frontend form to the backend (`login.php`) using JavaScript fetch API.
- Validated login credentials against the MySQL database and ensured proper redirection on success/failure.

---

###  Admin Dashboard Layout with UI Styling

- I created the **entire Admin Dashboard layout**.
- Styled it with modern and responsive UI using **CSS**, ensuring a clean and intuitive experience.
- Introduced a **sidebar layout** with tabbed sections for easier navigation.

---

###  User Creation using Factory Pattern

- I applied the **Factory Design Pattern** to dynamically create user roles (`admin`, `teamlead`, and `user`).
- This allowed flexibility and scalability in how new users are handled and created in the system.

---

###  Assign Team Lead from Users

- I implemented the ability for admins to **promote users to team leads**.
- Created a dropdown populated from the database using AJAX.
- Developed backend logic to update roles securely and efficiently.

---

###  UI Changes for All Dashboards

- I refactored and restyled the **Admin, Team Lead, and User dashboards** to follow a consistent visual language.
- All dashboards now share:
  - Sidebar with tabbed navigation
  - Clean layout with section separation
  - Professional styling for forms, buttons, and task boards
